# projekat_rpr amarTahirovic_19006

This is a project I created in a course called Developement of Program Solutions in 2022/23 (third semester at Faculty of Electrical Engineering UNSA). It is an application made for Zookepers working with animals so that they can easily see how many animals they have in each habitat. The app can be accessed by signing in or signing up. It can be run in IntelliJ terminal by typing the next two commands:

mvn clean install
mvn clean javafx:run

App class contains instructions on how to use Command Line Interface (CLI) for basic operations. The .jar file used to run the CLI is in "out" folder
